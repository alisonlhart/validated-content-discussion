# validated-content-discussion
A place for review of validated content candidates and general discussion around validated content.


## Candidate Review Workflow

Candidates are submitted by internal groups or partners to the [Ansible Validated Content Submission Form](https://redhat-cop.github.io/cop/automation-cop/validated-content-submit.html). 

After submission, Partner Engineering will open an issue in this repo with the issue name `candidate: <collection.name>`. The candidate issue template contains the requirements checklist, which Partner Engineering and members of the ACoP will have ~2 weeks to review. 

The review due date will be the next ACoP meeting ~2 weeks away from the issue opening date. 

_(Note: If there are a large number of candidates in the queue, this timeframe may increase)_

If there is a general agreement on validating the content, Partner Engineering will open a PR for final sign-off. This PR will **only** contain the addition of the candidate name and descripion to the table in [validated-content-list.md](validated-content-list.md). 

On the due date, Partner Engineering and the ACoP will do a live final sign-off at the biweekly ACoP meeting.
